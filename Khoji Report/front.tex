All glories to Allah Almighty, the most merciful, the most benevolent, who bestowed upon us his blessings and gave us the strength to face the challenges in this life and guided us to choose the right path along the way.

\par This is all made possible due to the prayers and utmost support of our parents. No matter what difficulties they faced, they kept us unaware of the problems and supported us, both morally and financially.

\par Last but not least, it was because of the valuable guidance of our project supervisor, Mr. Mudassar Ali Khan, who despite his busy schedule, gave us his valuable time and tolerated our mistakes and motivated us to be our best selves.

As we know, Man is a social animal. There is always the need to connect to one's loved ones and to easily find them, especially in this crowded world. Although, there are several Apps out there that provide the services to keep track of a user's location, none of them support Augmented Reality in their App for now. In this report, we propose a simple, cheap but efficient architecture that will keep track of a user's location at any point in time and show his current location to his contacts in real-time, using Augmented Reality. 
\par Augmented Reality (AR) is a technique that is used to show virtual objects on the real-world images. By integrating Augmented Reality into a location tracking App, the App will allow users to see and navigate towards their desired destination markers in the real-world. Thus, users will be able to easily visualize where their contacts are and quickly pick them out in a crowded space.
\par The goal of this thesis is to devise a cheap way to keep track of a user's location in real-time and use it to show a contact's location using Augmented Reality technology. We also plan to include messaging functionality in the App so the users could easily communicate with one another during the navigation.
